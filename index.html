        <div>Things go south. Sometimes it happens, when you cannot figure out what is going on with technology and why
            it is being a bully to you. I hate bullies! I'll appear and all the tech issues will disappear! I'm not
            going to wear a cape though, ever.</div>

        <h4>Funny thing happened the other day</h4>
        <div>So I was going to sneeze when my wife was around, and our two cats. I could not reach a handkerchief,
            my brain was in a fight or flight situation. Sneezing on wife was a no go, wife would be sad. Our one
            cat, Kai was right in front of me, the other one Nami was to my right. Wife was to my left. Behind me
            were electrical plugs. My brain could not process that I could just sneeze into my arm. I just let go of
            all thought and sneezed directly into the face of our poor cat Kai. He had the look of betrayal in his
            face. Now every time I am about to sneeze Kai just runs off. Sorry Kai, for causing you PTSD!</div>
